# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the Requirement Analysis Project for a booking management system. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear, structured foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring both functional and non-functional requirements, creating use cases, acceptance criteria, and visual diagrams to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for designing and developing software that aligns with business goals and user requirements.

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis plays a critical role by:

- **Clarifying project scope:** It defines what the system should and shouldnâ€™t do, helping prevent scope creep.
- **Identifying functional requirements:** Specifies the features and functions the system must provide.
- **Identifying non-functional requirements:** Defines performance, security, usability, and reliability standards.
- **Establishing acceptance criteria:** Sets conditions that must be met for stakeholders to accept the final product.
- **Supporting design and development:** Provides a clear blueprint for developers, testers, and project managers.
- **Reducing risks:** Ensures miscommunication or misunderstanding of requirements is minimized, saving time and cost.

By thoroughly performing Requirement Analysis, teams can ensure a structured, efficient, and successful software development process.
