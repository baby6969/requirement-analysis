# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the Requirement Analysis Project for a booking management system. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear, structured foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring both functional and non-functional requirements, creating use cases, acceptance criteria, and visual diagrams to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for designing and developing software that aligns with business goals and user requirements.

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis plays a critical role by:

- **Clarifying project scope:** It defines what the system should and shouldn’t do, helping prevent scope creep.
- **Identifying functional requirements:** Specifies the features and functions the system must provide.
- **Identifying non-functional requirements:** Defines performance, security, usability, and reliability standards.
- **Establishing acceptance criteria:** Sets conditions that must be met for stakeholders to accept the final product.
- **Supporting design and development:** Provides a clear blueprint for developers, testers, and project managers.
- **Reducing risks:** Ensures miscommunication or misunderstanding of requirements is minimized, saving time and cost.

By thoroughly performing Requirement Analysis, teams can ensure a structured, efficient, and successful software development process.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software developed meets stakeholder expectations and business goals. Key reasons for its importance include:

1. **Clarifies Project Scope:**  
   Requirement Analysis defines what the system should and shouldn’t do, helping prevent scope creep and misunderstandings during development.

2. **Reduces Development Risks:**  
   By identifying and documenting requirements early, potential issues, miscommunications, and gaps are minimized, saving time and cost during later stages.

3. **Guides Design and Implementation:**  
   Well-analyzed requirements provide a clear blueprint for developers, testers, and project managers, ensuring the system is built correctly the first time.

4. **Enhances Stakeholder Satisfaction:**  
   With clear acceptance criteria and documented requirements, stakeholders can validate that the software meets their needs, increasing trust and satisfaction.

5. **Supports Testing and Quality Assurance:**  
   Accurate requirements allow testers to create meaningful test cases and validate that the system behaves as expected.
